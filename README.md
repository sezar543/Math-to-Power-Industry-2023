# Analyzing Deforestation in the Amazon Basin with Machine Learning

## Abstract

Using machine learning, we analyze Amazon basin deforestation data. Inspired by the 2016 Kaggle competition “Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space,” we enhance standard CNNs like ResNet50 with tensor network techniques, reducing parameters and complexity. Our contribution involves replacing traditional CNNs with “Tensorized” CNNs, achieving improved performance. This project presents a benchmarking analysis comparing Tensorized CNNs to conventional ones for Amazon basin deforestation tracking.
